    + Plot by total damage
    + Plot by DPS
+ The following strategies were added to the DPS calculation:
    + DPS relative to join time
    + DPS relative first hit
    + DPS relative to quest timer

- Environmental damage
- Damage done by other monsters
- Damage done by ailments (e.g: Poison, blast, etc)
