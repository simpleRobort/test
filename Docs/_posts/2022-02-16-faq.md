## Windows is asking me to install .NET 6, what do I do?
HunterPie requires **.NET 6.0 Desktop Runtime** to run properly, you can download it from Microsoft's official site by clicking [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.7-windows-x64-installer).

## Moving and Scaling Widgets

To move a widget you can either use Design Mode (togglable by pressing the default hotkey: ScrollLock) or set the absolute coordinations in HunterPie's settings.
To scale a widget, you can go to HunterPie's settings for that widget and use the Scale slider.

> For more information about widgets, check the [Overlay](/posts/overlay) and [Widgets](/posts/widgets) documentations.

## Why aren't my settings saving?

Make sure your HunterPie's folder is **not** in read only mode, if that doesn't work, try moving your HunterPie folder to somewhere else.

## My auto update is getting stuck

Same as the previous issue, make sure your folder is **not** in read only mode, also try moving its folder somewhere else.

## My overlay seems delayed

Some people has reported that as a Windows 11 issue, some known work arounds for that include:
- Changing rendering strategy to **Software** in HunterPie's setttings.
- Enabling compatibility mode for HunterPie
