The Wirebug Widget is responsible for tracking and displaying all your Wirebugs information as cooldown, timer and if they're available or not. This widget is quite simple and follows the same design as the in-game Wirebug gauge.

## Widget Structure

## In-Game HUD

Replacing the in-game Wirebug Gauge is quite simple, while in-game, open the HUD settings and disable the `Wirebug Gauge`.

> **Attention:** Disabling the in-game Wirebug Gauge also disables the Wirebug aim, to fix this, enable the `Patch in-game Wirebug Aim` option in your HunterPie's Wirebug settings.
