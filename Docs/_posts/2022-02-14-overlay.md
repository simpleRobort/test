Overlay is one of HunterPie's core features, it is responsible to manage every single [Widget](/posts/widgets).

## Design Mode

Design Mode makes all Widgets visible to mouse events, making them clickable and allowing the user to interact with them. When Design Mode is active you can drag-and-drop Widgets with your mouse, scale linearly with your mouse scroll and also individually close a widget you don't want to see anymore.

To toggle design mode, you can use <kbd>ScrollLock</kbd> or whatever Hotkey you set in your HunterPie's configuration.
