HunterPie v2.0.20 brings some new features and fixes.

## General

+ Patch notes button now opens the current update patch notes in HunterPie's documentation
+ Added supporter tokens, allowing [Patreons](https://www.patreon.com/HunterPie) to receive beta updates
+ Added some development options to the Advanced Debug Tools

## Abnormality Trays
Abnormality Trays are bars that track and display your character's buff and debuff timers, they can be used in case you want to know how long your Hunting Horn buff will last, for example.

As of now, HunterPie supports the following categories for buffs, not all of the buffs are supported, but they will be added whenever possible:

- Songs
- Consumables (this also includes environment buffs)
- Debuffs
- Gear skills
- Food skills

## Monster Widget

### New features

Monster Widget has gotten some visual enhancements to the parts components, now it displays flinch, break and sever values. Since all parts have flinch values, the bars will still show that info once you can no longer break/sever it.

+ Added horizontal orientation for Monster Widget.
+ Added dynamic resizing for health bars depending on how many monsters the Widget is showing at the moment
+ Added minimum width for Monster health bars
+ Added flinch, severable and breakable parts

### Parts
Each color represents a different type of part:

Color | Represents | Description
:----:|:----------:|--------------------
<ion-icon name="prism" style="fill:#22aae1;"/> | `Flinch` | Flinch values represent when the monster is going to flinch or get staggered.
<ion-icon name="prism" style="fill:#fdc45b;"/> | `Break`  | Break values represent when a part is about to break.
<ion-icon name="prism" style="fill:#e53737;"/> | `Sever` | Severable parts are the ones that can be cut off from a monster.
<ion-icon name="prism" style="fill:#7f7f7f;"/> | `Broken` | A part will become Grey when it's either broken or severed. 

#### Severable parts

Severable parts are the parts that can be physically removed from the monster's body, like tail and horns.

#### Breakable parts

Breakable parts are the parts that can be broken, showing the "Part was broken" message in the game.
