// pch.h: This is a precompiled header file.
// Files listed below are compiled only once, improving build performance for future builds.
// This also affects IntelliSense performance, including code completion and many code browsing features.
// However, files listed here are ALL re-compiled if any one of them is updated between builds.
// Do not add files here that you will be updating frequently as this negates the performance advantage.

// HOW TO USE THIS FILE (https://cplusplus.com/articles/2z86b7Xj/)
// The "pch.h" header must be the very first one to be included into the *.c/*.cpp file.
// This is obligatory! Otherwise you are guaranteed to get compilation errors.

#ifndef PCH_H
#define PCH_H

// add headers that you want to pre-compile here
#include "framework.h"
#include <cstdio>
#endif //PCH_H
